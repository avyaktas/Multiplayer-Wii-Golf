Below the dashed line, include easily understandable and verifiable 
citations to all the major sources you used for your project, as described
in the TP document: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/term-project-and-hack112.html#tp-policies

In addition, your code must also include citations directly in the code that 
make it clear where you use code that is partly or entirely not of your 
original design, and what the source is for that code.

tkolenci:
    -All images were drawn using OpenAI(ChatGPT, Gemini, or Co-Pilot)
    -ChatGPT/OpenAI was used in debugging/gaining ideas for the following
     functions. Each function will have a scale for how much OpenAI was 
     consulted.
        -DrawCliff: Somewhat but not much, Avy helped.
        -DrawCliffBetter: Very helpful, gave idea and some of the logic
                          (had errors).
        -drawStart: Not really, see comments for details.
        -drawInstructionsPage: Somewhat, Andrew helped with this.
        -drawLandingPage: More then the two previous, bounding all the boxes
                          was quite difficult for me.
        -drawCardPage: very little, just minor debugging.
        -drawReconnect: None.
        
        

Avy - 
Used chatGPT to help with the flatten function used in the drawCoursePolygons function and also used 
chat to help with th drawCourse Polygon function. Overall,  this fucntion heloped witht zooming in to the course 
and using the keys to pan around the course. 
Used chatGPT to cache the images for getHoleData

nmeaney
    - Used chatGPT for creating ocean images. 
    - Used chatGPT for debugging especially after implementing multiplayer retroactively. The Ai didn't write anyCode but rather looked through code 
       and checked for discrepencies.
    - Used chatGPT for implementing some of the windLogic
