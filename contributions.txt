Below the dashed line, for each group member, clearly specify which sections of 
the code are predominantly your own original contributions, as described in
the TP document: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/term-project-and-hack112.html#personal-contributions

Example: 

General
    - Generally, 
        -tkolenci: All drawing and GUI
        -nmeaney & achurche: Worked together closely on the physics, 
                             acceloremeter, making a stable connection,
                             bounce, etc. (All physics and game logic)
        -avys: Worked mostly on openCV. Also he made the templates of the
               podium, landingPage, and designed each course by
               handdrawing the course.
tkolenci
    -Designed image Converter(scraped)
    -Designed Isometric view(also scrapedðŸ˜¡)
    -Designed startPage, instructions page, landing page, card page, and
        podium. (Avy gave a general template however, all templates needed
                 major changes.)
    -Made all pages resizable with minimal change. (I.e., no graphics are
        hardCoded)
    -Designed all of error page(Nelson helped greatly with the initalization
                                of the page)
    -Generally made or polished all GUI.
    -Found all fonts, colors, images, etc. for all pages.
    -Edited and introduced all sounds.

Nelson
    - accelerometer api(with andrew)
    - holeSketch and graphicsTogether(perlimary startPage and hole1)
    - Ball moving logic and physics
    - get Terrian function to find what surface the current ball l
    - Top down redesign to support multiplayer 
    - 

Andrew
    -Preliminary accelerometer api (spent hours with Nelson debugging)

Avy
    - got the graphicsTogether hole logic to work... maped values from openCv func
      into values that work for cmu graphics 
    - score card
    - drew podium
    - worked on ball physics
    - worked on landing page
    - worked on restart game button logic
    - worked on inputting names on landing page and selecting how many players are playing
