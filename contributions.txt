Nelson
    - accelerometer api(with andrew)
    - holeSketch and graphicsTogether(perlimary startPage and hole1)
    - ball moving logic  and physics
    - terrian logic
    - 

Andrew
    -Preliminary accelerometer api (spent hours with Nelson debugging)

Avy
    - got the graphicsTogether hole logic to work... maped values from openCv func
      into values that work for cmu graphics
