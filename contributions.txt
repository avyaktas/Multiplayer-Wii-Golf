Below the dashed line, for each group member, clearly specify which sections of 
the code are predominantly your own original contributions, as described in
the TP document: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/term-project-and-hack112.html#personal-contributions

Example:

Nelson
    - accelerometer api(with andrew)
    - holeSketch and graphicsTogether(perlimary startPage and hole1)
    - ball moving logic  and physics
    - terrian logic

Andrew
    -Accelerometer api (with Nelson)
    -Initial ball motion
    -Ball physics
    -Shadow motion and logic
    -Club physics
    -Bounce logic
    -Landing in different terrain logic
    -Landing out of bounds logic
    -Putting physics
    -Deviation logic

Avy
    - got the graphicsTogether hole logic to work... maped values from openCv func
      into values that work for cmu graphics 
    - perlimary score card, and working on multiplater logic
