tkolenci
    -Designed image Converter
    -touched up graphics

nmeaney
    - accelerometer api(with andrew), including the seemless integration with main app. 
    - Ball physics, including deviation, 
    - get Terrian function to find what surface the current ball is.
    - Top down redesign to support multiplayer, including using OOP for players 
    - Wind logic 
    - Ball in hole logic and who's turn logic 
    - A lot of game logic in genral.

    - score card
    - drew podium
    - worked on landing page and finsihed it
    - worked on restart game button logic
