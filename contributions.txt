Below the dashed line, for each group member, clearly specify which sections of 
the code are predominantly your own original contributions, as described in
the TP document: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/term-project-and-hack112.html#personal-contributions

Example: 

tkolenci
    -Designed image Converter
    -touched up graphics

Nelson
    - accelerometer api(with andrew)
    - holeSketch and graphicsTogether(perlimary startPage and hole1)
    - Ball moving logic and physics
    - get Terrian function to find what surface the current ball l
    - Top down redesign to support multiplayer 
    - 

achurche
    - accelerometer api (with Nelson)
    - ball motion physics
    - different club physics
    - Angle deviation physics
    - Shadow physics
    - Bouncing physics
    - Landing in water physics
    - Putting logic
    - Which clubs are available logic

Avy
    - got the graphicsTogether hole logic to work... maped values from openCv func
      into values that work for cmu graphics 
    - score card
    - drew podium
    - worked on ball physics
    - worked on landing page and finsihed it
    - worked on restart game button logic
    - worked on inputting names on landing page and selecting how many players are playing
