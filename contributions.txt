Below the dashed line, for each group member, clearly specify which sections of 
the code are predominantly your own original contributions, as described in
the TP document:

General
    - Generally, 
        -tkolenci: All drawing and GUI
        -nmeaney & achurche: Worked together closely on the physics, 
                             acceloremeter, making a stable connection,
                             bounce, etc. (All physics and game logic)
        -avys: Worked mostly on openCV. Also he made the templates of the
               podium, landingPage, and designed each hole by
               outlining features of the course.
tkolenci
    -Designed image Converter(scraped)
    -Designed Isometric view(also scrapedðŸ˜¡)
    -Designed startPage, instructions page, landing page, card page, and
        podium. (Avy gave a general template however, all templates needed
                 major changes.)
    -Made all pages resizable with minimal change. (I.e., no graphics are
        hardCoded)
    -Designed all of error page(Nelson helped greatly with the initalization
                                of the page)
    -Generally made or polished all GUI.
    -Found all fonts, colors, images, etc. for all pages.
    -Edited and introduced all sounds.

nmeaney
    - accelerometer api(with andrew), including the seemless integration with main app. 
    - Ball physics namely: deviation for imperfect shots, wind, club multipliers and velocities
    - get Terrian function to find what surface the current ball is.
    - Top down redesign to support multiplayer, including using OOP for players 
    - Ball in hole logic and who's turn logic 
    - A lot of game logic in genral including most of on step etc. 


achurche
    - accelerometer api (with Nelson)
    - ball motion physics
    - different club physics
    - Angle deviation physics
    - Shadow physics
    - Bouncing physics
    - Landing in water physics
    - Putting logic
    - Which clubs are available logic

Avy
    - got the main hole logic to work... maped values from openCv func (chatGPT used)
      into values that work for cmu graphics 
    - outlined each hole (manually in goodnotes on ipad)
    - score card (2d gried kinds of)
    - drew podium
    - worked on landing page 
    - worked on restart game button logic
    - worked on inputting names on landing page and selecting how many players are playing
    - worked on switching from card to hole and hole to card
    - worked on switching names on hole when players alternate swings
    - worked on total score and O/U
    FUNCTIONS WORKED ON: 
    - redrawAll: switching pages and stuff
    - getHoleData: drew all the holes and imported them, made this fucntion but used chatGPT to cache everything
    - flatten: used chatGpt is was a debugging thing
    - drawCoursePlolygon - used chat look at citations
    - drawPolygons
    - isInPlayButton
    - isInHoleButton
    - isInRestartButton
    - isInStartButton
    - isInNextHoleButton
    - onMousePress: Did not work on all of it but worked on a lot of it
    - onKeyHold: worked on moving the screen with left right up down
    - onKeyPress: worked on the stuff to input name and ipaddress
    - drawCardButton
    - drawHoleButton
    - drawCardPage: Worked on this but it was tweaked by tommy
